JS8Android is the Android port of JS8Call.

## Beta status

This port is *wildly* beta. The interface has many parts that are stubbed and do not
function in any way. Currently RX and TX work, as do basic auto-reply responses.
Basic network rig control via rigctld works, plus USB rig control via Hamlib. The GUI *will* change. Not
responsible for this code doing unexpected things, draining all of your batteries, or
kidnapping your pets. User beware.

## Android Port Summary

- Extracted a platform-agnostic core engine under `core/` with public headers in
  `core/include` and protocol/DSP implementations in `core/src`.
- Added an Android adapter layer in `adapters/android/` plus a JNI bridge in
  `adapters/android/jni` (native `js8_engine_jni.cpp` with Kotlin/Java wrappers).
- Introduced a Gradle/NDK build in `android/` with the `js8core-lib` AAR module and
  `app` example, including FFTW3 build scripting in `android/build-fftw3.sh`.
- Implemented a foreground decoding service (`JS8EngineService`) and AudioRecord
  capture via `JS8AudioHelper`, with UI updates delivered through local broadcasts.
- Built a Material 3 Android UI (Monitor, Decodes, Transmit, Settings) with
  ViewModel-backed decode buffering for multipart messages.

See `android/README.md` for build and usage details, and
`android/ENGINE_INTEGRATION_COMPLETE.md` for the end-to-end architecture notes.

## History - JS8Call

JS8Call is an experiment in combining the robustness of FT8 (a weak-signal mode by
K1JT) with a messaging and network protocol layer for weak signal communication.
The open source software is designed for connecting amateur radio operators who are
operating under weak signal conditions and offers real-time keyboard-to-keyboard
messaging, store-and-forward messaging, and automatic station announcements.

* July 6, 2017 - The initial idea of using a modification to the FT8 protocol to
  support long-form QSOs was developed by Jordan, KN4CRD, and submitted to the WSJT-X
  mailing list: https://sourceforge.net/p/wsjt/mailman/message/35931540/
* August 31, 2017 - Jordan, KN4CRD, did a little development and modified WSJT-X to
  support long-form QSOs using the existing FT8 protocol:
  https://sourceforge.net/p/wsjt/mailman/message/36020051/ He sent a video example to
  the WSJT-X group: https://widefido.wistia.com/medias/7bb1uq62ga
* January 8, 2018 - Jordan, KN4CRD, started working on the design of a long-form QSO
  application built on top of FT8 with a redesigned interface.
* February 9, 2018 - Jordan, KN4CRD, submitted question to the WSJT-X group to see if
  there was any interest in pursuing the idea:
  https://sourceforge.net/p/wsjt/mailman/message/36221549/
* February 10, 2018 - Jordan KN4CRD, Julian OH8STN, John N0JDS, and the Portable
  Digital QRP group did an experiment using FSQ. The idea of JS8Call, combining FT8,
  long-form QSOs, and FSQCall like features was born.
* February 11, 2018 - Jordan, KN4CRD, inquired about the idea of integrating
  long-form messages into WSJT-X:
  https://sourceforge.net/p/wsjt/mailman/message/36223372/
* February 12, 2018 - Joe Taylor, K1JT, wrote back:
  https://sourceforge.net/p/wsjt/mailman/message/36224507/ saying that "Please don't
  let my comment discourage you from proceeding as you wish, toward something new."
